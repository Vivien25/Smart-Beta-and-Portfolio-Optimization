# Smart-Beta-and-Portfolio-Optimization

In this project, I build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, I calculate the tracking error against the index. Then I build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. This portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance need to be balanced. I use this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. For the dataset, the end of day from Quotemedia is used.
